1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find your extension and click the refresh icon
3. Reload any open LinkedIn pages

## Production Deployment

For distributing to users:

1. Create a ZIP file of your extension folder
2. Upload to the Chrome Web Store (requires developer account)
3. Follow the Chrome Web Store guidelines for publishing

# Security and Advanced Usage Notes

## Security Considerations

### Credential Storage
- The plugin stores credentials in Chrome's local storage, which provides basic security but is not foolproof
- Consider implementing encryption for stored passwords
- Add an option for users to use OAuth instead of storing passwords directly

### API Communication
- All API calls are using HTTPS which provides transport security
- Consider adding request rate limiting to avoid IP blocks from LinkedIn
- Implement proper error handling for network failures
- Add request timeouts to prevent hanging operations

### Token Management
- The current implementation refreshes tokens before they expire
- Consider implementing a more robust token validation system
- Add automatic re-login if refresh token expires

## Advanced Usage Notes

### Human-like Interaction
- The plugin implements random delays between actions to mimic human behavior
- Consider adding more randomization in scrolling behavior
- Add random mouse movements before clicking elements

### LinkedIn Detection Prevention
- LinkedIn monitors for automated activity
- Consider implementing advanced detection avoidance:
  - Vary timing between sessions
  - Limit total number of actions per day
  - Add natural scrolling patterns
  - Implement IP rotation if needed for high-volume users

### Error Recovery
- Current implementation has basic error handling
- Consider adding:
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Session recovery after browser restart
  - State persistence across failures

### Customization Options
- Consider adding user-configurable options:
  - Number of posts to like per profile
  - Custom delay settings
  - Profile targeting preferences
  - Action schedules (time of day, days of week)
  - Automation intensity settings (aggressive vs. conservative)

## Maintenance Notes

### LinkedIn DOM Changes
- LinkedIn frequently updates their DOM structure
- The selectors used for finding like buttons may need periodic updates
- Consider implementing a more robust selection mechanism that can adapt to minor changes
- Implement a remote configuration system to update selectors without extension updates

### API Changes
- Monitor the Quorini API for any endpoint or parameter changes
- Set up automated testing to detect API contract changes

### Chrome Updates
- New Chrome versions may affect extension behavior
- Test regularly with Chrome beta/dev channels to catch issues early

# Testing and Troubleshooting Guide

## Manual Testing Process

1. **Initial Setup Testing**
   - Install the extension using Chrome developer mode
   - Open LinkedIn and verify the floating button appears
   - Click the button and ensure the registration form displays
   - Complete the registration with test credentials
   - Verify the verification code process works
   - After verification, confirm the plugin shows "Setup Complete"

2. **Authentication Testing**
   - Verify token storage in Chrome storage (using Developer Tools → Application → Storage → Local Storage)
   - Test token refresh functionality by manually expiring the token
   - Verify logout and re-login process works

3. **LinkedIn Interaction Testing**
   - Navigate to LinkedIn and verify plugin detects it
   - Ensure participant list is fetched correctly
   - Test like functionality on a test profile
   - Verify the plugin correctly identifies already-liked posts

4. **Background Process Testing**
   - Test daily reminder by changing the alarm period temporarily to 1 minute
   - Verify notification appears and clicking it navigates to LinkedIn

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Popup Not Loading
- Check for JavaScript errors in the console
- Verify all files are correctly included in manifest.json
- Check paths for scripts and stylesheets

### API Calls Failing
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Verify authentication headers are correctly set
- Ensure URLs match the expected endpoints
- Test API endpoints directly with Postman or similar tool

### LinkedIn Selectors Not Working
- Use the console to test selectors directly:
  ```javascript
  document.querySelectorAll('button span.artdeco-button__text').forEach(el => console.log(el.textContent));
  ```
- LinkedIn may have updated their DOM structure
- Update selectors in content.js as needed

### Permissions Issues
- Ensure all required permissions are in manifest.json
- Check Chrome extension settings to confirm permissions are granted
- Try reinstalling the extension

## Performance Testing

1. **Memory Usage**
   - Monitor memory consumption in Chrome Task Manager
   - Check for memory leaks during extended use
   - Optimize DOM operations to reduce memory footprint

2. **CPU Usage**
   - Monitor CPU usage during automation
   - Reduce intensive operations or add delays if CPU usage is high
   - Be especially careful with scrolling and DOM manipulation

3. **Network Efficiency**
   - Minimize API calls
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Handle network failures gracefully

## LinkedIn-Specific Testing

1. **Detection Testing**
   - Run the plugin with increased delays to test LinkedIn's detection mechanisms
   - Monitor for any warning messages from LinkedIn
   - Check if account gets restricted after extended use

2. **Multiple Profile Testing**
   - Test with various LinkedIn profile types
   - Verify compatibility with company pages
   - Test with profiles having different UIs or languages

## Troubleshooting Workflow

If automation isn't working properly:

1. Check console logs for errors
2. Verify network requests are succeeding
3. Test selectors directly in console
4. Manually step through automation process
5. Increase logging verbosity for debugging
6. Test with simplified LinkedIn pages (fewer posts)
7. Try on different LinkedIn accounts if possible
